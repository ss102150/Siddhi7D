    <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <p>
      Born on October 2, 1869, in the coastal town of Porbandar, Gujarat, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was raised in a deeply religious household where his mother's Jain-influenced teachings on vegetarianism and nonviolence became his moral bedrock, though he was a shy and mediocre student who struggled with public speaking in his youth.<br>
      <br>
      After a brief and unsuccessful attempt to practice law in India following his education at University College London and the Inner Temple, Gandhi accepted a job in South Africa in 1893, where the searing humiliation of being thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg for his race served as a "moment of truth" that transformed him into a relentless civil rights activist for the next 21 years.<br>
      <br>
      It was in South Africa that he pioneered Satyagraha—a method of direct, nonviolent resistance based on "truth-force"—organizing the Indian community to burn registration certificates and march against discriminatory laws, eventually forcing the government to negotiate.<br>
      <br>
      Returning to India in 1915, he spent his first year traveling the country by train to understand its people before taking up the cause of oppressed indigo farmers in Champaran and textile workers in Ahmedabad, victories that established him as a national hero and the soul of the Indian National Congress.<br>
      <br>
      Over the following decades, he orchestrated massive nationwide campaigns like the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920, where he urged Indians to spin their own Khadi cloth to boycott British textiles, and the legendary 1930 Salt March, a 240-mile trek to the sea that galvanized the world's attention against the British salt tax. <br>
      <br>
      Even during his many years of imprisonment, Gandhi maintained a rigorous discipline of prayer, fasting, and spinning, using his "soul force" to demand the removal of the "untouchability" stigma and the promotion of Hindu-Muslim unity.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the "Do or Die" intensity of the Quit India Movement in 1942 leading to eventual freedom in 1947, Gandhi’s heart was broken by the violent Partition of the subcontinent; he spent his final months walking barefoot through riot-torn villages to restore peace, only to be assassinated on January 30, 1948, by a Hindu extremist in Delhi.<br>
      <br>
      His life remains an enduring testament to the power of one individual's conscience, inspiring the civil rights movement in America and anti-apartheid struggles in Africa, proving that nonviolence is a weapon of the strong rather than a refuge for the weak.
