<li> Potato is a magician<br>
Potato can be boiled<br>
Potato can be steamed<br>
Or become potato chips<br>
Potato is a magician<br>
I like that potato<br> <li>

Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom<br>

[Verse 1: Han, Changbin]<br>
(Brrah) I hit the black dot right at the center<br>
And even my swift plan<br>
On a perfect scene without a blind spot<br>
I dance as I planned keep going<br>
Sick of this life, it's regular
I overate victory, so full<br>
To go for a stroll I wear the belt around my waist<br>
We go to the universe all the rest kneel, I'm strong<br>

[Pre-Chorus: I.N, Seungmin, Bang Chan]<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's nothing I can't do, I do it (Do it)<br>
Just pull out my trigger, I got that (Woo)<br>
I'ma pop, pop, pop, take a shot, yeah<br>
Shoot down my goals one by one, I snipe them<br>
Filling up my truck<br>
Yeah, you want that ride (Boom)<br>
Hit you like a truck<br>
I'ma make you fly<br>

[Chorus: Hyunjin, Lee Know]
(Boom) Vamos, I know that you want it<br>
(Boom) Lobos, we cannot stop hunting<br>
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it<br>
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom<br>
(Boom) Comе on, I know that you want it<br>
(Boom) Chaos, we so catastrophic<br>
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it<br>
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom<br>


[Verse 2: Han, Felix, Changbin]<br>
(Boom) Destroying the cliché is more of a cliché itself<br>
(Boom) Maintain all the opinions about me<br>
(Boom) Nothing's changed, I'm not a changed man<br>
My next move is still only applied to the next level<br>
To the goal step by step<br>
I took a step closer<br>
I'm the owner of my goal, lucky to have me as an owner<br>
I make it right zeroing in clear<br>

[Pre-Chorus: I.N, Seungmin, Felix]<br>
Breaking the silence<br>
My trigger, fire (Fire)<br>
Raise the target higher<br>
To the end over there (My friend)<br>
Filling up my truck<br>
Yeah, you want that ride (Boom)<br>
Hit you like a truck<br>
I'ma make you fly<br>

[Chorus: Felix, Bang Chan]<br>
(Boom) Vamos, I know that you want it<br>
(Boom) Lobos, we cannot stop hunting<br>
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it<br>
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom<br>
(Boom) Come on, I know that you want it<br>
(Boom) Chaos, we so catastrophic<br>
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it<br>
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom<br>
[Outro: Hyunjin, Lee Know]<br>
Dig in deeper<br>
My bullet goes "Tang, tang, tang"<br>
This is the crazy life<br>
This is, good shot, shot, shot<br>
Dig in deeper<br>
My bullet goes "Tang, tang, tang"<br>
This is the crazy life<br>
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom<br>
