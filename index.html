Potato is a magician<br>
Potato can be boiled<br>
Potato can be steamed<br>
Or become potato chips<br>
Potato is a magician<br>
I like that potato<br>

<p>
I can't remember when I had my own free time<br> 
To busy doing this and that, oh how time flies<br>
Can I even do more? When will I fall?<br>
Flooded by my own questions, what's it all for?<br>
Who am I kidding? Take me outdoors<br>
S-O-S geasture, what's it all for?<br>
I wanna feel the sun bring me to life<br>
I just wanna see me run under the light<br>
Without a thought in my head, I'ma take a deep breath<br>
Just fill up my chest, I don't want any stress
