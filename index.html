<p> <em>
A wise old man was<br> talking to a boy and <br> said, "There are two wolves fighting<br> inside me. One is filled<br> with anger, hate, jealousy,<br> shame, and lies.<br> The other wolf is filled with<br> love, joy truth and peace.<br> This battle rages inside<br> of you on inside of you<br> and all men." The boy thought <br> for a moment and asked<br> "which wolf will win?"
The old wise man answered<br> " The one you feed" </p> </em>
