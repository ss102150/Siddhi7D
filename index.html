Potato is a magician<br>
Potato can be boiled<br>
Potato can be steamed<br>
Or become potato chips<br>
Potato is a magician<br>
I like that potato<br>

<p>
I can't remember when I had my own free time<br> 
To busy doing this and that, oh how time flies<br>
Can I even do more? When will I fall?<br>
Flooded by my own questions, what's it all for?<br>
Who am I kidding? Take me outdoors<br>
S-O-S geasture, what's it all for?<br>
I wanna feel the sun bring me to life<br>
I just wanna see me run under the light<br>
Without a thought in my head, I'ma take a deep breath<br>
Just fill up my chest, I don't want any stress<br>
I just wanna be that bird flying so high<br>
Mm, yeah, I'm sick and tired as I'ma need a holiday<br>
I've been working herd, no cap<br>
Just let me take a break, let me take a break<br>
Oh, I can't go on, I'm just stuck<br>
Need a holiday, n-need a holiday
Oh, I can't move on, I'm so lost<br>
Let me take a break, let-let me take a break<br>
Better, better days will come<br>
And the feelings that moved will go back to normal<br>
The Earth is round, but tomorrow feels like<br>
It has a sharp corner that I'll crash into<br>
My friend, it's been so hard,<br>
Look what we've done, it's so bright, it's time<br>
We should put a hammock under the shade and take a nap<br>
Our time is split into tiny minutes<br>
And we're just flexing by getting through them<br>
Instead of fighting, let's give and share love and peace, one love<br>
We need some rest<br>
If we lose something, we'll just find it again<br>
We don't care at all, let us take a break<br>
I just wanna feel the sun bring me to life <br>
I just wanna see me run under the light <br>
Without a thought in my head, I'ma take a deep breath<br>
Just fill up my chest, I don't want any stress<br>
I just wanna be that bird flying so high <br>
Mm, yeah, I'm sick and tired as I'ma need a holiday <br>
Need a holiday, need a holiday<br>
I've been working hard, no cap, yeah, just let me take a break<br>
Let me take a break, let me take a break<br>
Oh, I can't go on, I'm just stuck<br>
Need a holiday, ne-need a holiday,<br>
Oh, I can't move on, I'm so lost<br>
Let me take a break, let-let me take a break<br>
When I'm gone, don't even try to find me<br>
Let me be, 'cause I've been at it for so long<br>
When I'm ready, I'll be back, don't worry<br>
Let me take a break, le-let me take a break<br>

Let me take a break<br>
