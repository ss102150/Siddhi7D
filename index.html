        <h1> A Wise Old Man<b> </b> </b> </h1>
<p> <em>
A wise old man was<br> talking to a boy and <br> said, "There are two wolves fighting<br> inside me. One is filled<br> with anger, hate, jealousy,<br> shame, and lies.<br> The other wolf is filled with<br> love, joy truth and peace.<br> This battle rages inside<br> of you on inside of you<br> and all men." The boy thought <br> for a moment and asked<br> "which wolf will win?"
The old wise man answered<br> " The one you feed" </p> </em>

 <h1> IF by Rudyard Kipling<b> </b> </b> </h1>
 If you can keep your head when all about you  <br> 
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,    <br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too;    <br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br>
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, <br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, <br>
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: <br>
 <br>
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   <br>
  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;    <br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken <br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br>
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: <br>
 <br>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br>
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br>
    And never breathe a word about your loss; <br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,    <br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br>
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <br>
 <br>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   <br> 
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, <br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much; <br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br>
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,    <br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   <br> 
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! <br>
